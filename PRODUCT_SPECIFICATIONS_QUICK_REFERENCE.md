## Treatment Technologies

### AOAO Process (Biological Purification)
**Anaerobic Phase**:
- Large molecules decompose into small molecules
- Organic matter breakdown begins

**Aerobic Phase**:
- Microorganisms adsorb and oxidize organics
- Reduces ammonia nitrogen and COD

**Result**: Natural, efficient pollutant reduction

---

### Advanced Treatment Tank
**Functions**:
- Phosphorus removal
- Deodorization
- Decolorization
- Suspended solids (SS) filtration

**Technology**: Advanced filler materials with purification and filtration effects

---

### Disinfection Methods

#### UV Disinfection (Standard)
**Application**: General use, normal microbial loads
**Mechanism**: Destroys DNA of bacteria, viruses, fungi
**Result**: Chemical-free sterilization

#### ECR Disinfection (High Load)
**Application**: High microbial biomass (up to 1×10^10 cfu/mL)
**Mechanism**:
- Produces strong oxidants (·OH, HOCl/ClO-) through electrolysis
- Converts organic pollutants to CO2
- Converts ammonia nitrogen to N2
- Kills all bacteria and viruses
**Result**: Complete pathogen elimination

---

## Optional Accessory: Sludge Harmless Treatment Equipment

### Purpose
Treat sedimentation tank sludge to completely harmless state

### Technology
**Electrocatalysis**:
- Generates free radicals and residual chlorine
- Destroys proteases in bacteria
- Kills E. coli and other harmful bacteria
