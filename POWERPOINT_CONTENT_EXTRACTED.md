### Slide 19: Process Flow & Technology

#### Process Flow
1. Toilet black water (input)
2. Biological purification tank
3. Advanced treatment tank
4. ECR
5. UV
6. Reuse or up to standard discharge (output)

#### Core Philosophy
**Concept**: "Returning to nature with the power of nature"

#### Biological Purification Tank
**Process**: AOAO process is adopted, and sewage is treated anaerobic and aerobic in the biological purification tank.

**Anaerobic Treatment**: Under anaerobic conditions, large molecules decompose into easily decomposable small molecules

**Aerobic Treatment**: Through aerobic treatment, organic matter in the sewage layer is continuously adsorbed and oxidized by microorganisms, resulting in a decrease in index of pollutants such as ammonia nitrogen and COD in the water.

#### Advanced Treatment Tank
**Function**: Utilizing the purification ability and filtration effect of advanced treatment filler materials to further degrade organic matter and filter SS, achieving the effects of phosphorus removal, deodorization, and decolorization.

#### Disinfection and Sterilization (ECR)
**Two Types Available**:

**① UV - General application**:
The radiation ability of ultraviolet radiation can destroy the DNA molecular structure of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc., causing them to lose their reproductive and growth abilities, thereby achieving the purpose of sterilization.

**② ECR - When the microbial biomass is very high (up to 1*10^10 cfu/mL)**:
ECR must be used to produce strong oxidants such as · OH and HOCl/ClO - through electrolysis, which can convert organic pollutants in sewage into CO2, convert ammonia nitrogen into nitrogen, and kill various bacteria and viruses.

### Slide 20: Physical Design
