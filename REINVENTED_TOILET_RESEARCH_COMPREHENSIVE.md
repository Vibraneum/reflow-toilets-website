### Recommended Tone and Voice

**For B-CRT Technical Page:**

**Overall Tone:**
- **Authoritative:** Backed by research and data
- **Confident:** Clear capability statements
- **Transparent:** Honest about specifications and limitations
- **Professional:** Engineering precision without being dry
- **Accessible:** Technical depth with clarity

**Voice Characteristics:**
- **Active Voice:** "B-CRT treats wastewater through 8 stages" not "Wastewater is treated"
- **Present Tense:** "The system removes 95% of BOD" not "will remove"
- **Direct:** "Meets ISO30500 standards" not "designed to potentially meet"
- **Specific:** "Reduces pathogen count by 6 logs (99.9999%)" not "eliminates most pathogens"

**Example Paragraph (Good):**

"The B-CRT employs an 8-stage treatment process combining physical, biological, and chemical methods to transform raw wastewater into reusable water meeting ISO30500 standards. Stage 1 through 3 remove 70% of suspended solids via screening and sedimentation. Stages 4-5 utilize moving bed biofilm reactors (MBBR) to achieve 90% BOD reduction through aerobic biological treatment. Membrane ultrafiltration in Stage 6 ensures pathogen removal exceeding 99.99%. Final disinfection stages (7-8) employ UV treatment and electrolysis to achieve effluent quality suitable for toilet flushing and irrigation (BOD <10 mg/L, E. coli <1 MPN/100mL)."

**Why It Works:**
- Specific stages numbered (8-stage)
- Treatment methods categorized
- Performance quantified (70%, 90%, 99.99%)
- Standards referenced (ISO30500)
- End use stated (toilet flushing, irrigation)
- Parameters specified (BOD <10 mg/L)
