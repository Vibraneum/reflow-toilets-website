## FAQ SECTION (Government-Focused)

### Section Headline
```
Frequently Asked Questions from Government Partners
```

### Top 6 FAQs

**Q1: What partnership models does ReFlow offer for government deployments?**
```
A: We offer three primary models: (1) Pilot Programs for evaluation,
(2) District Rollouts for comprehensive coverage, and (3) PPP Partnerships
for revenue-sharing arrangements. Each can be customized to your jurisdiction's
needs and budget.
```

**Q2: How does ReFlow support RFP and tender processes?**
```
A: We provide comprehensive tender support including technical specification
customization, compliance documentation, reference project information, site
visits, and clarification responses. Our team has experience with municipal,
state, and international development procurement processes.
```

**Q3: What certifications and regulatory compliance does ReFlow maintain?**
```
A: ReFlow systems are ISO30500-compliant for non-sewered sanitation. We meet
Indian BIS standards, CPCB wastewater standards, and can comply with
international environmental regulations. All certifications are third-party
verified and documentation is available.
```

**Q4: What is the typical implementation timeline?**
```
A: Pilot programs deploy in 8-12 weeks from contract signing. District-wide
rollouts follow a phased approach: Assessment (4 weeks), Pilot (8-12 weeks),
Rollout (6-12 months depending on scale). Our prefabricated approach is
significantly faster than traditional construction.
```

**Q5: How is long-term maintenance and operations handled?**
```
A: We offer multiple models: (1) Municipal operations with our training and
support, (2) LooCafe partnership for private operations, or (3) Long-term
operations contracts. Our IoT platform enables predictive maintenance and
remote monitoring regardless of operations model.
```

**Q6: What is the expected ROI for municipal investments?**
```
A: ROI depends on deployment model and local conditions, but our revenue-
generating LooCafe partnership model typically achieves positive ROI within
3-5 years. We provide customized financial modeling during the assessment
phase. Zero ongoing electricity and water costs significantly reduce OPEX.
