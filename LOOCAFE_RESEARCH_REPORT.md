## Research Conclusion

LooCafe presents a compelling business model and technology platform, but maintains limited technical detail on their public website. This appears intentional, likely to protect proprietary information and because their primary sales process is B2B/B2G where detailed specs are shared privately.

**For ReFlow Toilets Design Page**: We can confidently reference LooCafe's proven platform, deployment scale, partnerships, and general design approach. However, for specific technical claims, ReFlow must either:

1. Obtain detailed specifications directly from LooCafe
2. Develop and verify its own specifications for B-CRT enhanced units
3. Focus messaging on B-CRT unique value rather than inherited LooCafe specs

**Key Insight**: ReFlow's differentiation is B-CRT technology, not just replicating LooCafe's design. The design page should emphasize this circular economy innovation while acknowledging the proven foundation.
