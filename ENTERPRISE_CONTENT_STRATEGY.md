## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive content audit and transformation strategy to reposition ReFlow Toilets from consumer-focused messaging to enterprise/government-targeted communications. The strategy leverages the company's unique strengths: Gates Foundation partnership, ISO30500 compliance, proven technology, and district-scale deployment capability.

**Key Findings:**
- Current messaging is too general and consumer-oriented
- Missed opportunities to emphasize government/institutional benefits
- Strong foundation (Gates Foundation, B-CRT technology) underutilized
- CTAs need professional, action-oriented language
- Limited content addressing policy, regulatory, and infrastructure concerns
