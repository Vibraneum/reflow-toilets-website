### Page 7: Revenue & Sustainability Model (🔥 UNIQUE SELLING POINT MISSING!)

**Extracted Content:**

**Title**: "The Primary Innovation Is the sustainability model"

#### Revenue Stream 1: The ReFlow Partner
```
ReFlow collects a partnership fee from the person running the PoS
at the unit. This is a mutual partnership fee depending on the needs
of the consumer.
```

#### Revenue Stream 2: Advertisement Panels
```
All 4 sides, and walls inwards, have advertisement spaces available.
Legal, commercially available spaces with data for advertisers.
```

#### Revenue Stream 3: Tech & Community
```
With our patented Facility management toilet tech, we go beyond our
units, we can [manage] other structures and also monetize through our
digital community
```

**Diagram**: "Operations + Toilet tech = Sustainability = Revenue for sustainability"

**Current Website**: ❌ Revenue model NOT explained at all!
**Impact**: Governments don't understand financial sustainability

**Website Integration Priority**: 🔴 **HIGH - Critical for government sales**

**Recommended New Section**: "Financial Sustainability Model" or "Self-Sustaining Operations"

**Copy to Add:**
```markdown
## Self-Sustaining Business Model

ReFlow Toilets operate on a revolutionary financial sustainability model
with three revenue streams:

### 1. Partnership Operations
Municipal partnerships with trained operators who manage daily operations.
Partnership fees cover maintenance and operations without ongoing government
subsidies.

### 2. Advertisement Revenue
Legal advertisement spaces on all four exterior walls and interior panels
provide consistent revenue. Data-driven ad placement maximizes advertiser ROI
while covering operational costs.

### 3. Technology Licensing
Our patented facility management technology extends beyond ReFlow units,
creating additional revenue streams through licensing and digital community
monetization.

**Result**: Zero ongoing cost to municipalities after initial installation.
Units pay for themselves through operations.

## Build-Operate-Transfer (BoT) Model

All ReFlow units can be deployed on a Build-Operate-Transfer basis:

- **Build**: We construct and install the complete unit
- **Operate**: We manage operations for agreed period
- **Transfer**: Full ownership transfers to municipality

This de-risks deployment for government agencies and ensures
operational excellence from day one.
```

### New Page: `/sustainability-model` (Financial Model)

**Page Structure:**

```markdown
# Self-Sustaining Financial Model

Zero ongoing costs to municipalities after installation

## The Primary Innovation: Financial Sustainability

ReFlow Toilets don't just solve sanitation - we solve the
financial sustainability problem that has plagued public toilets
for decades.

## Three Revenue Streams

### 1. Partnership Operations
**The ReFlow Partner Model**

Local entrepreneurs operate the Point of Sale (PoS) attached to
each ReFlow unit. Partnership fees cover:
- All maintenance costs
- Staff salaries
- Consumables (soap, paper, etc.)
- Cleaning services
- Repairs and upkeep

**Result**: Municipality pays nothing for ongoing operations.

---

### 2. Advertisement Revenue
**Legal Commercial Spaces with Data**

Every ReFlow unit offers prime advertisement locations:
- All 4 exterior walls
- Interior wall panels
- High-traffic visibility
- Data-driven advertiser ROI

Advertisement revenue provides:
- Consistent monthly income
- Premium brand partnerships
- Data for advertisers (foot traffic, demographics)

**Result**: Additional revenue stream beyond operational costs.

---

### 3. Technology Licensing
**Patented Facility Management Platform**

Our toilet management technology extends beyond ReFlow units:
- License to other facility operators
- Digital community monetization
- Data insights for urban planners
- API access for smart city platforms

**Result**: Scalable revenue independent of unit deployment.
