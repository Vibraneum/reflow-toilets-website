### Philosophy: Returning to Nature

#### ADD FROM POWERPOINT:
**Title**: "Returning to Nature with the Power of Nature"

**Our Approach**:
While many sanitation technologies rely on harsh chemicals and energy-intensive processes, we take a different path. Our AOAO (Anaerobic-Aerobic-Anaerobic-Aerobic) biological process mimics the natural purification cycles found in wetlands, rivers, and soil.

**Nature's Wisdom**:
For millions of years, ecosystems have perfected the art of breaking down organic matter and purifying water. Anaerobic bacteria decompose complex molecules, while aerobic microorganisms oxidize and mineralize pollutants. We've harnessed these natural processes, optimizing them for modern sanitation needs.

**The Result**:
A system that works with nature, not against it. Low energy consumption, minimal chemical use, and outputs that can safely return to the environment—just as nature intended.

---

### Vision: Green, Low-Carbon, Zero-Carbon

#### ADD FROM POWERPOINT:
**Our Technology Roadmap**:

**Today: Ecological Toilets**
Current b-CRT and b-HRT systems represent our first generation—ecological toilets that eliminate sewage infrastructure dependence while protecting the environment.

**Tomorrow: Low-Carbon Toilets**
Next-generation systems will further reduce energy consumption, optimize biological processes for faster treatment, and integrate renewable energy sources.

**Future: Zero-Carbon Toilets**
Our ultimate goal: sanitation systems that generate as much energy as they consume, potentially through biogas recovery, solar integration, and ultra-efficient biological processes.

**Mission**:
"Dedicated to becoming a leading enterprise in ecological toilet technology—not just in China, but globally."

## 4. TECH PAGE (/tech)

### AOAO Process Deep Dive

#### ADD FROM POWERPOINT:
**Title**: "AOAO Biological Process: Nature's Purification, Engineered for Excellence"

**What is AOAO?**
AOAO stands for Anaerobic-Aerobic-Anaerobic-Aerobic—a multi-stage biological treatment process that alternates between oxygen-free and oxygen-rich environments to maximize pollutant breakdown.

**Stage 1 & 3: Anaerobic Treatment**
- **Environment**: Oxygen-free zones
- **Process**: Anaerobic bacteria break down large, complex organic molecules into smaller, more easily biodegradable compounds
- **Benefits**: Handles tough-to-treat organics, reduces overall biological load

**Stage 2 & 4: Aerobic Treatment**
- **Environment**: Oxygen-rich zones
- **Process**: Aerobic microorganisms continuously adsorb and oxidize organic matter
- **Targets**: Ammonia nitrogen reduction, COD (Chemical Oxygen Demand) reduction
- **Benefits**: Rapid mineralization of pollutants, efficient nutrient removal

**Why Multiple Cycles?**
Each anaerobic-aerobic cycle further refines water quality. By alternating environments, we target different pollutant types and achieve far superior results than single-stage systems.

**Result**: Dramatic reductions in all key pollution indicators through natural biological processes.

- Challenging water quality situations
- Maximum pathogen kill requirements

**How It Works**:
ECR (Electrochemical Reactor) uses electrolysis to produce powerful oxidizing agents:
- **Hydroxyl radicals (·OH)**: Strongest oxidant available, destroys cellular structures
- **Hypochlorous acid/chlorine ions (HOCl/ClO-)**: Penetrates cell walls, kills pathogens

**Chemical Reactions**:
- Converts organic pollutants → CO₂ (complete mineralization)
- Converts ammonia nitrogen → N₂ (harmless nitrogen gas)
- Destroys all bacteria, viruses, and parasites

**Advantages**:
- ✓ Handles extreme contamination
- ✓ Complete pathogen elimination
- ✓ Reduces chemical pollutants simultaneously
