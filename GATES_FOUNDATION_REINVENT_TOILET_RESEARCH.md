## 5. Failures & Lessons Learned

### The Commercialization Gap

**Core Problem**:
> "The commercialization of new technologies takes time, however: There are more challenges to overcome before reinvented sanitation solutions can protect the health and well-being of billions around the world, at scale."

**Reality Check**:
- None of the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge winners have "ticked all the boxes" yet
- 14 years after launch, **zero toilets at full commercial scale** serving low-income communities
- Technologies proven in lab, but **commercial deployment remains elusive**

### Specific Challenges Identified

#### 1. Cost Barriers (Critical Failure Point)

**Target vs. Reality:**
- Goal: **$0.05/user/day** ($18/year/user)
- Prototype costs in India (2014): **~$600 per unit**
- Current costs: **"Way too high"** for low-income communities
- Assessment: **"Prohibitively expensive for mass provision"**

**Gates Foundation Statement**:
> "The biggest challenge is that no matter the approach or innovation, the cost of reinvented toilets and other water-efficient sanitation technologies is way too high to reach the people who need them most."

**Cost Reduction Strategy (Announced 2024-2025):**
- Target high-income markets first (emergency response, public toilets in developed countries)
- Use initial sales to drive manufacturing scale
- Leverage volume to reduce costs for low-income markets
- **Timeline**: 3-5 years minimum before affordable versions available

#### 2. Engineering and Reliability Challenges

**Duke University's Experience:**
> "Both of Duke's Reinvent the Toilet Challenge projects have faced their share of obstacles over the years, some easier to anticipate than others. For Deshusses's high-pressure, high-temperature machine, the challenge has been solving engineering problems where others have already failed."

**Parts and Supply Chain Issues:**
- Reliability problems with specialized components
- Short lifespan of custom parts
- Cost implications of proprietary technology
- Foundation working with experts to develop "good-quality parts" that can be manufactured quickly and cheaply

**Field Testing Challenges:**
- CalTech team: "When any part of a test toilet breaks, someone on the team has to fly out to fix it."
- Demonstrates impracticality for remote deployment without local repair capacity

#### 3. One-Size-Fits-All Problem

**Community-Specific Needs:**
- Every community has **"unique and dynamic sanitation needs"**
- Cannot be addressed with single system or service
- Cultural preferences vary widely
- Infrastructure contexts differ dramatically

**Behavioral Challenges:**
> "The challenge is getting communities to dig, maintain and use latrines in remote and difficult to access rural communities. In other words, getting people to change their behavior."

#### 4. Policy and Government Barriers

**Lack of Public Sector Mandates:**
- Governments not motivated to invest in new solutions
- **"Without clear public-sector mandates to provide safe sanitation services to everyone, governments, regulators, and utilities in many countries are not motivated to find or invest in new solutions."**
- Existing procurement frameworks favor conventional infrastructure
- Risk aversion in government purchasing

**Market Development Challenge:**
> "We already have the breakthrough technologies needed to provide safe and affordable sanitation services to the billions of people who are at risk of waste-borne diseases. Building markets and attracting businesses to this emerging sector are the next big challenges."

#### 5. Maintenance and Complexity Issues

**High-Tech in Low-Resource Settings:**

**Cranfield's Nano Membrane Toilet Example:**
- Uses state-of-the-art nanotechnology
- **Requires**: Batteries, regular servicing of complex/proprietary parts
- **Requires**: Safe, dry removal of wax-coated solid waste
- **Problem**: Not maintainable by local communities without specialized expertise

**CalTech Sol-Char Toilet:**
- Uses expensive fiber optic cable for concentrated solar
- Original quote: **$20,000 for 4 meters of cable**
- Negotiated to $500 (97.5% cost reduction achieved)
- Still requires parabolic mirrors, precision alignment, spare parts

### The "Appropriate Technology" Critique

#### Core Criticism

**Historian Leo Marx's Warning:**
> "We are keen to conflate technological breakthroughs with social progress. It makes sense then, that we cast challenges like ending poverty or unsanitary conditions as technical problems in need of inventions, rather than social problems in need of political action."

#### Specific Critiques of Gates Approach

**Alternative Investment Questions:**
- Why not fund governments to build sewer systems?
- Why not provide monetary assistance for sanitation workers?
- Why not scholarships for public utility management training?
- Why build technology that negates need for public sanitation systems?

**Unintended Consequences:**
- High-tech toilets may create **new sanitation problems**
- Dependency on proprietary parts/expertise
- Lack of local ownership and maintenance capacity
- Bypasses institution-building and governance improvements

**Fundamental Question:**
> "Why does it seem easier to build a toilet out of experimental polymers than just build a sewer?"

#### Low-Tech Alternatives Overlooked

**Existing Proven Solutions:**
- Pit latrines with proper ventilation (VIP latrines)
- Composting toilets (low-cost, proven technology)
- Biogas digesters (mature technology, 40+ years deployment)
- Container-based sanitation (Sanergy model - simple, scalable)

**Cost Comparison:**
- VIP latrine: **$50-$200**
- Composting toilet: **$100-$500**
- Gates-funded reinvented toilet: **$10,000-$50,000+** (estimated current costs)

### Technologies That Failed to Scale (As of 2025)

**Based on public evidence, the following have NOT reached commercial scale:**

1. **CalTech Solar-Powered Toilet** (2012 winner)
   - Status: Field testing in India, China, South Africa
   - Issue: Still requires team to "fly out to fix" when parts break
   - Assessment: Not commercially deployed at scale

2. **Loughborough Biochar Toilet** (2012 second place)
   - Status: Research and design phase as of 2014
   - Issue: No clear evidence of commercialization
   - Assessment: Unknown current status, likely stalled

3. **University of Toronto UV/Smolder Toilet** (2012 third place)
   - Status: No information on commercialization found
   - Assessment: Appears to have not progressed beyond prototype

4. **Cranfield Nano Membrane Toilet**
   - Status: Subject of "appropriate technology" criticism
   - Issues: Complex, proprietary, requires specialized maintenance
   - Assessment: Unlikely to reach scale in current form

5. **University of Colorado Sol-Char Toilet**
   - Status: Reduced fiber optic costs from $20K to $500
   - Issues: Still relies on expensive parabolic mirrors
   - Assessment: Cost reduction progress, but commercialization unclear

**Only Potential Success Story:**
- **Eco-San (China)**: First ISO 30500 certified, deployed in schools
- **However**: Scale and sustainability not well-documented in public sources

### Lessons Learned (Gates Foundation's Own Assessment)

#### Pivot from R&D to Commercialization (2018+)

**What Changed:**
- Shifted focus from inventing new technologies to **making existing ones affordable**
- Acknowledged: **"We already have the breakthrough technologies"**
- New priority: **"Building markets and attracting businesses"**

#### Parts and Manufacturing Strategy

**Problem Identified:**
- Reliability, short lifespan, cost of specialized components

**Solution:**
- Working with experts to develop standardized, high-quality parts
- Focus on **manufacturing scale** to drive costs down
- ISO 30500 standard to enable interoperability

#### Dual-Market Strategy (2024 Announcement)

**High-Income Markets First:**
- Emergency response (disaster zones, refugee camps)
- Public toilets in developed countries
- Institutions willing to pay premium for off-grid capability

**Goal**:
- Generate demand and production volume
- Drive down costs through economies of scale
- **Then** deploy affordable versions in low-income settings

**Assessment**: Realistic acknowledgment that **direct deployment to poor communities failed**

#### Timeline Adjustment

**Original Ambition** (2011): Revolutionary toilets within 5-10 years

**Current Reality** (2025):
- 14 years in, still **3-5 years from market-ready products** (LIXIL estimate)
- Total timeline: **~20 years from launch to potential commercial availability**
- **Far slower than anticipated**

### What Actually Worked Better

**Sanergy's Low-Tech Model (Container-Based Sanitation):**
- Simple container-based toilets
- Manual waste collection and centralized processing
- Commercial products from waste (proven revenue model)
- **Serves 120,000+ people** - likely more than all "reinvented toilets" combined
- Scalable, maintainable, locally owned

**Omni-Processor (Janicki):**
- Community-scale treatment (not individual toilet)
- Processes waste from 50,000-100,000 people in Dakar
- Generates commercial products: water, electricity, fertilizer
- **$1.5M cost**, but **pays for itself** through product sales
- **Four locations operating globally** (more success than individual reinvented toilets)

### Cost Comparison: Reinvented Toilets vs. Traditional Sanitation

#### Reinvented Toilet Economics (Current)

**Estimated Unit Costs** (based on available data):
- Early prototypes: **$10,000-$50,000+**
- India pilot (2014): **$600/unit** (Gates Foundation report)
- LIXIL target: **$500-$1,000** (aspirational, 3-5 years away)
- Gates target: **$0.05/user/day = $18/user/year**

**Cost per User (assuming 200 users per toilet over 10 years):**
- At $10,000/unit: **$5/user/year**
- At $1,000/unit: **$0.50/user/year**
- At Gates target: **$0.09/user/year** (for toilet only, excluding operations)

**Operational Costs** (estimates):
- Electricity: $100-$500/year
- Maintenance/parts: $500-$2,000/year
- Repairs: $1,000-$5,000/year (given complexity)
- **Total operational**: $1,600-$7,500/year

**True Cost per User (200 users, 10 years, $1,000 toilet, $3,000/year operations):**
- Capital: $0.50/user/year
- Operations: $15/user/year
- **Total: $15.50/user/year** (far above $0.05/day = $18/year target when you include operations)

#### Traditional Sanitation Costs

**Pit Latrine:**
- Construction: **$50-$200**
- Lifespan: 10-20 years
- Maintenance: **$10-$50/year**
- Cost per user: **$0.50-$2/user/year** (10 users)

**VIP Latrine (Ventilated Improved Pit):**
- Construction: **$100-$300**
- Lifespan: 15-25 years
- Maintenance: **$20-$100/year**
- Cost per user: **$1-$3/user/year** (10 users)

**Septic Tank System:**
- Construction: **$500-$2,000**
- Lifespan: 20-40 years
- Maintenance: **$50-$200/year**
- Cost per user: **$2-$10/user/year** (20 users)

**Sewer Connection (where infrastructure exists):**
- Connection fee: **$100-$500**
- Monthly fee: **$5-$20/month**
- Cost per user: **$15-$60/user/year** (household of 4)

**Container-Based Sanitation (Sanergy Model):**
- Toilet cost: **$100-$300**
- Service fee: **$3-$5/month**
- Cost per user: **$9-$15/user/year** (4 users)
- **Revenue from waste**: Offsets costs, potentially profitable

#### The Affordability Gap

**Key Finding**: Even at aspirational costs, reinvented toilets are **more expensive** than traditional alternatives:

| Solution | Cost per User per Year |
|----------|----------------------|
| Pit Latrine | $0.50-$2 |
| VIP Latrine | $1-$3 |
| Reinvented Toilet (target) | $15-$20 |
| Reinvented Toilet (current estimate) | $50-$100+ |
| Sewer (where available) | $15-$60 |

**Conclusion**: The $200M investment has **not yet created** toilets that are cost-competitive with traditional solutions.

### Scalability Challenges

#### Manufacturing Scale

**Current Status:**
- **LIXIL**: 24 prototypes manufactured (not commercial production)
- **Eco-San**: Unknown production volume (schools and public toilets in China)
- **Other licensees**: Limited or no production data available

**Required Scale** (to serve 2.3B people):
- Assume 200 users per toilet
- Need: **11.5 million toilets**
- At $1,000/unit: **$11.5 billion** in manufacturing
- At current pace: **Decades to reach this scale**

#### Supply Chain Gaps

**Specialized Components:**
- Fiber optic cables (Sol-Char)
- Nano-membrane filters (Cranfield)
- Supercritical reactors (G2RT mSCWO)
- Electrolysis systems (Eco-San)

**Problem**: No mass-market supply chains exist for these components at required price points

#### Maintenance Infrastructure

**Local Repair Capacity:**
- Reinvented toilets require specialized expertise
- **CalTech experience**: Team must fly to site for repairs
- **Not sustainable** for millions of toilets in remote areas

**Spare Parts:**
- Proprietary components (vendor lock-in)
- Long lead times for replacement parts
- High costs for specialized parts

**Training:**
- Local technicians need advanced training
- Ongoing support from manufacturers required
- **Barrier to independence** and local ownership

### What Would Success Look Like?

**Gates Foundation's Original Vision:**
- Toilets at **$0.05/user/day** (~$18/user/year total)
- Deployed to **2.3 billion people** without sanitation
- Locally maintainable, no external dependencies
- **Timeline**: Within 10-15 years (by 2021-2026)

**Current Reality (2025):**
- Costs still **10x-100x too high**
- Deployed to **thousands** (not billions)
- Require external expertise for maintenance
- **Timeline**: At least **5+ more years** before commercial products

**Comparative Success: Sanergy**
- **$40M** in Gates/USAID funding (vs. $200M for Reinvent the Toilet)
- Serves **120,000 people** (more than reinvented toilets combined)
- Financially sustainable (revenue from waste products)
- Locally owned and operated
- **Scalable model**: Expanding to 1.3M people by 2025

**Assessment**: Dollar-for-dollar, **low-tech solutions have delivered more impact** than high-tech reinvented toilets.

## 7. Complementary Initiatives

### Omni-Processor (Janicki Bioenergy)

**Overview:**
- Community-scale fecal sludge treatment plant
- Developed by Peter Janicki, CEO of Janicki Industries
- Funded by Gates Foundation starting 2011 (separate from Reinvent the Toilet Challenge)
- Janicki Bioenergy founded 2014 to commercialize technology

**How It Works:**
1. Intake: Fecal sludge from pit latrines and septic tanks
2. Thermal drying: Boil sewage sludge, recover water vapor
3. Combustion: Dry sludge burned as fuel for boiler
4. Steam generation: Powers electricity generation
5. Water purification: Reverse osmosis for drinking water
6. Resource recovery: Fertilizer from ash

**Outputs:**
- **Drinking water**: 86,000 liters/day (distilled, potable)
- **Electricity**: 250-300 kilowatts (surplus for sale)
- **Fertilizer**: Ash for agricultural use

**Deployment:**

**Dakar, Senegal (Pilot - 2015):**
- Processes waste from **50,000-100,000 people**
- Treats **14 tons of sludge per day**
- Managed by Delvic (local organization)
- **Commercial products**:
  - Water sold for commercial/industrial use (automobile coolant)
  - Electricity used internally or resold
  - Ash sold as fertilizer

**Expansion (2019-2020):**
- Commercial-scale unit at Tivaouane Peulh treatment plant
- Target: Process **one-third of Dakar's fecal sludge**

**Global Deployment:**
- **Four locations operating worldwide** (specific locations not disclosed in public sources)
- S200 model specs: 92.3 m³ sludge/day, 99% moisture content
- Serves **100,000-200,000 people** per unit
- Footprint: **100 m² only**

**Economics:**
- Unit cost: **$1.5 million**
- **"Quickly pays for itself"** through product sales
- Fraction of energy, space, cost vs. traditional wastewater plants

**Success Assessment:**
- **More commercially successful** than individual reinvented toilets
- Four operating sites vs. zero commercial reinvented toilet deployments
- Proven revenue model from byproducts
- **Community-scale approach** more viable than individual household units

### ISO 30500 Standard Development

**Funding**: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation

**Purpose**: Create globally recognized certification for non-sewered sanitation

**Impact:**
- Legitimizes "reinvented toilet" product category
- Enables government procurement specifications
- Harmonizes performance requirements across countries
- **Most tangible success** of Gates sanitation investment

**Adoption**: USA, Canada (ANSI/CAN/IAPMO/ISO 30500)

---

## 8. Key Insights and Conclusions

### What Worked

1. **Technology Innovation**: 25+ breakthrough technologies created
2. **Standards Development**: ISO 30500 provides framework for future products
3. **Global Collaboration**: 48+ countries involved in solution development
4. **Awareness Raising**: Sanitation recognized as critical global challenge
5. **Ecosystem Building**: Research community, testing infrastructure, supply chain beginnings
6. **Community-Scale Solutions**: Omni-Processor showing commercial viability

### What Didn't Work

1. **Affordability**: **Failed to achieve $0.05/user/day target** - costs 10x-100x too high
2. **Commercialization**: **Zero toilets at commercial scale** for low-income users after 14 years
3. **Timeline**: **Far slower than expected** - 20+ years from launch to potential deployment
4. **Adoption**: **Governments not procuring**, users not buying
5. **One-Size-Fits-All**: **Ignored local context** and behavioral factors
6. **Complexity**: **Over-engineered solutions** not maintainable in low-resource settings

### The Appropriate Technology Debate

**High-Tech Advocates (Gates Foundation Position):**
- Revolutionary technology needed for revolutionary change
- Conventional infrastructure too expensive for 2.3B people
- Innovation can drive costs down through scale
- Off-grid solutions avoid dependency on government investment

**Appropriate Technology Critics:**
- Social/political problem requiring social/political solutions
- High-tech solutions create new dependencies (proprietary parts, expertise)
- $200M could have funded sewer systems or low-tech alternatives
- Over-engineering bypasses capacity-building and local ownership

**Evidence**: After 14 years, **appropriate technology critics appear vindicated**:
- Sanergy's low-tech model serves **more people** than reinvented toilets
- Traditional solutions (pit latrines, VIP latrines) remain **more affordable**
- Community-scale processing (Omni-Processor) more successful than household units

### Lessons for ReFlow Toilets and Similar Ventures

#### 1. Affordability is Paramount
- **Technology excellence ≠ market success**
- If not affordable, won't scale - period
- Target cost must be competitive with existing alternatives
- **Recommendation**: ReFlow's B-CRT must be **price-competitive with traditional public toilets**, not 10x more expensive

#### 2. Appropriate Complexity
- High-tech features only valuable if **locally maintainable**
- Proprietary components create vendor lock-in and dependency
- **Recommendation**: ReFlow should prioritize **simple, robust components** with local supply chains

#### 3. Community-Scale vs. Individual Units
- Omni-Processor (community-scale) more successful than individual toilets
- Centralized processing allows expertise concentration
- **Recommendation**: ReFlow's focus on **public toilet infrastructure** (not households) is strategically sound

#### 4. Dual-Market Strategy
- High-income markets subsidize development costs
- Volume from developed countries drives manufacturing scale
- **Recommendation**: ReFlow could target **smart city deployments** in developed countries first, then expand to lower-income markets

#### 5. Revenue from Waste
- Sanergy and Omni-Processor generate revenue from byproducts
- Makes business model sustainable
- **Recommendation**: ReFlow's emphasis on **resource recovery** (water recycling, etc.) is critical for viability

#### 6. Partnership with Government
- Government procurement drives scale
- ISO 30500 certification reduces government risk
- **Recommendation**: ReFlow should pursue **ISO 30500 certification** if applicable, engage government buyers early

#### 7. Realistic Timelines
- Gates Foundation: 14 years, still 3-5 years from market
- **Total: ~20 years** from R&D to commercial deployment
- **Recommendation**: ReFlow should plan for **10-15 year** commercialization timeline, not 3-5 years

### The $6 Billion Market Question

**Is it Real?**

**Boston Consulting Group's $6B projection assumes**:
1. Affordable products available ($500-$1,000 range)
2. Government mandates and procurement
3. Established supply chains
4. Consumer/institutional demand

**Current Reality**:
1. Products still too expensive (10x-100x over target)
2. Governments not mandating (no "pull" from market)
3. Supply chains nascent
4. Demand uncertain (unproven at scale)

**Verdict**: The $6B market is **potential, not actual**. It could materialize by 2030 IF:
- Costs reduced dramatically (requires 90%+ cost reduction)
- Governments start procuring (requires policy change)
- Products proven reliable at scale (requires years of deployment)

**Without these conditions**, the market remains hypothetical.
