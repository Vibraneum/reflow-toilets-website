Technical
 
Validation
 
&
 
Global
 
Context
 
The
 
B-CRT
 
technology
 
has
 
undergone
 
rigorous
 
testing
 
and
 
certification:
 
-
 
ISO
 
30500
 
compliance:
 
Meeting

Comparative
 
analysis
 
with
 
global
 
standards
 
shows
 
the
 
B-CRT
 
substantially
 
exceeds
 
conventional
 
sanitation
 
technologies:
 
-
 
Water
 
consumption:
 
98%
 
reduction
 
compared
 
to
 
conventional
 
systems
 
-

Implementation
 
Timeline
 
The
 
first
 
B-CRT
 
unit,
 
already
 
in
 
Hyderabad,
 
will
 
be
 
installed
 
within
 
72
 
hours
 
from
 
site
 
preparation
 
to
 
commissioning
 
and
 
fully
 
operational
 
within
 
96
 
hours
 
thereafter.
 
Following
 
this
 
first
 
installation
 
in
 
mid-June
 
2025,
 
we
 
will
 
scale
 
to
 
50
 
units
 
by
 
December
 
2025,
 
with
 
eventual
 
expansion
 
to
 
100
 
units.
 
With
 
the
 
land
 
allocation
 
for
 
manufacturing,
 
we
 
can
 
dramatically
 
accelerate
 
this
 
timeline,
 
achieving
 
the
 
full
 
100-unit
 
deployment
 
by
 
September
 
2025,
 
positioning
 
Hyderabad
 
as
 
India's
 
first
 
true
 
"CirculaReFlow
 
Capital"
 
before
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
year.
 
We
 
would
 
welcome
 
the
 
opportunity
 
to
 
provide
 
a
 
detailed
 
manufacturing
 
facility
 
plan
 
and
 
conduct
 
a
 
technical
 
demonstration
 
for
 
your
 
team.
 
Your
 
vision
 
for
 
Telangana's
 
technological
 
leadership
 
aligns
 
perfectly
 
with
 
our
 
mission
 
to
 
revolutionize
 
public
 
sanitation,
 
and
 
the
 
proposed
 
manufacturing
 
facility
 
would
 
cement
 
this
 
partnership
 
for
 
decades
 
to
 
come.
 
With
 
deep
 
appreciation
 
and
 
warm
 
regards,
 
Yours
 
sincerely,
